# 📘 Programming Languages Notes & Practice

Welcome to my **Programming Languages** repository!
This is my personal learning space where I document notes, practice code, and explore various programming languages—from the ground up.

## 🔍 Overview

This repository serves as a structured record of my journey as I learn and practice multiple programming languages. Each language will have:

* 📒 **Well-organized notes**
* 🧪 **Hands-on practice files**
* 🛠️ **Mini projects or exercises (where applicable)**

The goal is not only to understand syntax but also to master problem-solving, core concepts, and best practices in each language.

## 📌 Learning Path (Planned Order)

1. **C++** – Fundamentals of programming, OOP, memory management, STL ...
5. *(More languages will be added in the future...)*

## 📂 Repository Structure

```bash
Programming-Languages/
│
├── C++/
│   ├── Notes/            # Conceptual notes in Markdown or PDF
│   └── Practice/         # Code files of exercises and mini-projects
└── README.md             # This file
```

## ✅ Current Focus

I'm currently learning **C++**, building a strong foundation in:

* Variables, Data Types, Operators
* Control Structures (if, loops, switch)
* Functions and Recursion
* Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
* Pointers & Memory Management
* Standard Template Library (STL)

The `C++/` directory is actively being updated as I make progress.
